## Installation
Clone or download the repository.
- Go to your terminal and `cd` to the root of the site.
- Run `yarn install`
- Run `composer install`
- Change the line `var localsite = 'YOURLOCALDEV';` in your gulpfile.js
- Run `gulp`
- If you are using Laravel Valet, you are done! Just browse to the site.
- If you have issues getting the site running locally, make sure you have a .env file created.
- Then run `php artisan key:generate`
- `php artisan storage:link`
- `php artisan zap:build`
- Hopefully, that will get the site going for you.

- Create views, models, and controllers just like you usually do, then run `php artisan zap:build` to regenerate the site.
